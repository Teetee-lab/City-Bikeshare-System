## Overview
The Kaggle competition is about forecasting the use of bike-sharing systems in Washington DC. 
Bike-sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city. Using these systems, people are able to rent a bike from one location and return it to a different place on an as-needed basis. Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world.

The data generated by these systems make them attractive for researchers because the duration of travel, departure location, arrival location, and time elapsed are explicitly recorded. Bike-sharing systems, therefore, function as a sensor network, which can be used for studying mobility in a city. In this competition, participants are asked to combine bike ride-sharing historical usage patterns with weather data in order to forecast bike rental demand in the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C.

## Dataset Overview
The Dataset consists of:  
- datetime - hourly date + timestamp  
- season -  1 = spring, 2 = summer, 3 = fall, 4 = winter 
- holiday - whether the day is considered a holiday
- workingday - whether the day is neither a weekend nor holiday
- weather - 1: Clear, Few clouds, Partly cloudy, Partly cloudy
- 2: Mist + Cloudy, Mist + Broken clouds, Mist + Few clouds, Mist
- 3: Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered clouds
- 4: Heavy Rain + Ice Pallets + Thunderstorm + Mist, Snow + Fog 
- temp - temperature in Celsius
- atemp - "feels like" temperature in Celsius
- humidity - relative humidity
- windspeed - wind speed
- casual - number of non-registered user rentals initiated
- registered - number of registered user rentals initiated
- count - number of total rentals

## Summary
The first EDA we run on the train data shows that the season, workingday, holiday, and weather columns are categorical data. Also, the temp and atemp columns are normal distributions with a bell curve while humidity is negatively skewed. Coupled with that, windspeed and the label ('count') are both positively skewed which means that there are more positive values. The datetime column needs to be converted to datetime in order to view the summary per year, month, day, and hours of the demand for the bikes.

With that being said, we had to create new columns for the datetime, so that we can know the counts of bike demand per year, months, day and hour. Not only that, but we also change the season and weather data type to categorical.

The LightGBMLarge_BAG_L1 model performed much better than the baseline model with a rmse score of -32.291402; which is 71% much better than the initial algorithm; the fact that it was able to read the new features that were implemented 'year', month, day, hour, and 'season', 'weather' as a categorical to train the algorithms make it perform great on unseen test data. Also, when the LightGBMLarge_BAG_L1 was hyper-tuned with different parameters, it was able to search for a better LightGBMLarge_BAG_L1 model that fit the  unseen data.
